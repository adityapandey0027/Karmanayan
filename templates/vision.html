  <h1>Our Vision</h1>
  <p>
    At <strong>Karmanayan</strong>, we believe in aligning <em>karma (action)</em> with <em>nayan (vision)</em> — 
    building a conscious future driven by purpose and integrity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our journey is rooted in the idea that action without vision is chaos, and vision without action is a dream.
    Through education, technology, and ethical innovation, we enable communities and creators to
    walk the path of meaningful progress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Karmanayan is more than an initiative — it's a movement. A call to act intentionally, to dream boldly, and to
    shape the future with clarity and compassion.
